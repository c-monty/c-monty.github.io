Our project was on neatline. It is a robust mapping tool used for creating interactive exhibits. We researched what was possible with neatline 
along with a failed attempt to create our own interactive exhibit. This failed in part because the "free" method was much more difficult as 
as well as the tool is extremely complex, so much in fact, that an entire course could be dedicated to learning it.
