**Bio**

My name is Christian Montanari and I am in my third year at Brock, second year in IASC. I am interested in digital prototyping but I do not like to hold myself down to one specific thing. I like to think outside the box and enjoy what some may call "futurism." In the solo presentations I was the only person who opted to look at a fictional technology which inspired our future which is a good representation of how I like to look at our world. I am an optimist when it comes to technology, seeing the good in everything and a firm believer that the only way forwards is to work with technology, not attempt to undermine it. In our group project we took up the hardest path, and although I ultimated failed learning to use Neatline, I learned some valuable things along the way. I believe that my work in IASC will take me to website development, video game development, or perhaps even entrepreneurship in the future because I have a drive to make something lasting of myself. While I do not claim to have any expertise, there is nothing I cannot learn on computers.

## Featured Project

This project is targetted at the pop culture surrounding the internet before it had fully come to fruition. Based on the "cyberpunk" genre of science fiction books, this idea of cyberspace predates the internet by quite a bit. Altough cyberspace was much different than the internet today, they both described a network of computers all communicating with each other on a massive scale. More importantly, the dark worlds offered a realistic expectation of how skillful hackers would abuse such an expansive system. Unlike most people, my research consisted of reading fiction rather than a wikipedia page. I began by re-reading Gibson's "Sprawl series" and noting points of interest where we can observe the similarities between the two technologies. I think it is important to 'play' with the notion of what is possible in fiction because it inspires future generations.
