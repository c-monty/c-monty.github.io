1-In 1982 a prominent scifi writer wrote a story about a “mass consensual hallucination” in computer networks. One year later a group of researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” By 1990, the world wide web had been invented.

2-This allowed for people to access each others networks like never before. From “Cyberspace” in William Gibsons book series beginning with the short story “burning chrome” all the way to “Internet” in our lives. this technology changed the world forever. Its not to say Gibson invented the idea, but his work invigorated the public.

3-Popular media gave people what they wanted; Hope for the future of science. Imagine a readers surprise when they learn of the news that the scifi book they just read has a dedicated team of researchers currently assembling the idea. It was the stuff dreams were made of.

4-It is true however, that the awe of cyberspace dwarfs the internet in comprehension

5-The internet is very visual but cyberspace is physical. It isnt, but thats how it is supposed to 'feel' Hacking is more comparable to robbery than being hunched over in a desk breaking through fbi firewalls. Stimulant drugs are used to improve performance solidifying the idea that the entire body is involved in this task.

6-in Cyberspace, the individual are often in a state of flow. If anyone is unfamiliar with this term, very briefly, it is a state where you are completely focused on one specific task. The ideal productive mental state.

7-Because the engagement as well as ability to interact with cyberspace is so much higher than the internet, it creates an entire culture of people who have nothing but contempt for their physical bodies. They need them, but they love cyberspace. They do not care for 'meat' or body modifications, 'meat things'

8-Even the cover art suggests a physical interpretation of this cyber hallucination. This entire abstract concept can teach us a lot about how we perceive the world to unfold around us. The technology goes as far as to say human beings would be capable of conceptualizing space that is not 3D space.

9-That we are capable of visualizing something so different than our own basic human code. This is a rather optimistic thought but nonetheless interesting by itself.

10- had society gone down a different path, perhaps settling for the internet would seem ludicrous. To our dismay, the internet was hijacked by people who used words to represent the world. There would be no hallucination. Cyberspace proved to be a concept too out of reach and perhaps a bit out of touch with the rest of the world.

11- It might be interesting to think of what would have happened if Japan or China invented the internet. The world wide web would be different in ways we may not be able to understand. Any small change to the way the researchers processed information would lead to giant changes in the ultimate outcome.

12- A case (HAH GET IT!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!? I sorry :3) could be made for cyberspace to re-emerge as a possible future in the same situation the book describes. This situation is that AI are banned therefore it is possible very unique ways of processing information may be better suited in the mind of a human.

13- Though completely theoretical, it could be that a human, if able to visualize non 3D space would be better suited than a simple algorithm for some tasks. What I mean to say is that the book entertains the idea that if we could see and feel the data the way a machine does, perhaps whatever “common sense” is makes better decisions quicker than a machine

14-Cyberspace, the concept may have faded into obscurity but the name left its mark on history forever. So much so that I am sure some people who have no idea how a computer works would think cyberspace just means the internet.

15- While this technology may just be a remnant of futures past, you never know when it might once again emerge into the public eye with VR and neural interfaces. Or another case...
